afx-nuke-plugins
================

Requirements
------------
* Cuda
* Intel IPP (Community Licensing is free https://registrationcenter.intel.com/en/forms/?productid=2558)
* BOOST
* Nuke NDK
* IlmBase

Optional
--------
* Hoard

Build and Install
-----------------

On Linux, Cuda and Boost can be installed from your distros package management system. I perfer to download the latest version of CUDA from https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads and BOOST from https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/; though not required.  Intel IPP is quick to install with no addional setup required.

1. git clone https://github.com/AuthorityFX/afx-nuke-plugins.git
2. cd afx-nuke-plugins
3. mkdir build
4. cd build
5. cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$HOME/.nuke/afx-nuke-plugins" ..
6. make -j{N} (where N is the num of threads)
7. make install

To tell Nuke where to find the plugins...

Add the following line to init.py - eg. $HOME/.nuke/init.py
* nuke.pluginAddPath('{CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}')

Note: The path arg must be an absoulte path to the afx-nuke-plugins directory. $HOME will not be expanded.

If you want init.py in a location outside of Nuke default plugin path, export an ENV variable -
* export NUKE_PATH="path-to-dir-containing-init.py"


Plugin Descriptions
===================

AFXGlow — A beautiful glow with realistic falloff.  The extremely intuitive controls yield predictable results.

AFXSoftClip — Non-linearly reduce exposure.  The algorithm was originally written for use in Eyeon Fusion.  It’s much more intuitive than the Native Nuke implementation.

AFXToneMap — Exposure control, soft clipping, and dark contrast.

AFXMedian — Extremely fast median filter with sharpness parameter to reduce unwanted morphological changes and floating point size control.  Faster than Nuke’s native median filter by an order of magnitude.

AFXChromaKey — Generates a 2D polygon with CIELab (A, B) Cartesian coordinates to represent the chroma screen.  Alpha is 0 for pixels within polygon, otherwise, alpha is function of distance to polygon.  Matte is invariant to lighting and grading changes due to per frame chroma analysis.

AFXDespill — Uses Rodrigues rotation to shift screen hue to either 1/3 or 2/3.  Spill suppression is is calculated using simple RGB based de-sill algorithms. Outputs a normalized spill matte.

AFXAntiAlias — Morphological anti-aliasing to smooth ‘jaggies’ that are a very common problem with keying. Extremely useful for monitor comps.
